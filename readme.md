# Golag

It's like Gulag, but Go. Because it's written in Go.

Golag is (going to be) a flat-file blogging engine.

## The Whys

### Why Go?

Because Go's really awesome. It's typically fast, it has static typing, and I
like it. Also the tools are really nice.

### Why flat-file?

Flat-file has the main advantages I care about of traditional DB and static-site blogging engines: extreme portability due to it being a collection of files and not in a database; and it's all done on the web, instead of writing, generating, uploading.

### Why "Golag"

It's close to "golog", which combines "go" and "log", which is what this is. And
it's close to "gulag", which is just my sense of humor.
